To listen to a commentary node, put your crosshair over the floating commentary symbol and press your primary fire.
To stop a commentary node, put your crosshair over the rotating node and press your primary fire again.
Some commentary nodes may take control of the game in order to show something to you.
In these cases, simply press your primary fire again to stop the commentary.
In addition, your secondary fire will cycle you through all the commentary nodes in the level.
Please let me know what you think after you have had a chance to play.
I can be reached at gaben@valvesoftware.com, and my favorite class is the Spy. Thanks, and have fun!"""

However, you will be a lot more limited.


The sounds must be placed in a folder inside this directory.
Each folder is a \"game\", and you can have multiple folders.


Each sound will be limited to these factors:
  * $DURATION beats long by default
  * Loaded sound data must be under a megabyte. The editor WILL CRASH if it's too big!
  * You will be able to stretch the cues.
  * You will be able to change the duration of the cues.
  * The cues will not loop. If you want them to loop, you will have to manually add a game using the JSON files.

It is advised that you generate JSON versions of the custom games for more flexibility.

You can use data.json files if you need to quickly test databasing.

Supported audio formats are ogg, wav, and mp3.

Optionally, if you put an icon.png in the folder it will use it."""
