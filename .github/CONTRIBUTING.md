# Contributing to RHRE2
Firstly, thanks for considering helping me out on this project! I welcome any Pull Requests and Bug Reports. That being said, I have some 
standards which I enforce in order to keep this project organized, maintainable and high-quality. 

## Issues vs Pull Requests
I value issues just as much as I do pull requests. So if you are trying to decide on whether you should create an issue 
or create a pull request, ask yourself if it is worth making a pull request for. For example, making a pull request for 
fixing a single typo may not be better than just submitting an issue. That being said, a pull request fixing very many 
typos may be better for me than an issue. This is all subjective but you should take this into consideration.

## Issues
If there is a problem with a feature please tell me, just please make sure to follow the [template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)
in order to allow me to more easily identify the issue and fix it. Questions and suggestions are also welcome to be
posted as an issue.

## Pull Requests
So, you are thinking about sending a pull request, awesome! Before starting on your pull request, you should read up on
the [pull request template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) Just a few things to note when submitting a pull 
request:

1. All your contributions will be subject to the project's licence.
2. You cannot modify this project's style (i.e. indentation style, bracket style, naming, etc). I'll understand if you
do this by accident, but I'll expect you to fix it before I merge the pull request.
3. Your JSON formatting must be correct (fit the rest of the project's style) and valid.
4. ALWAYS merge into dev! If you don't merge into dev I will immediately reject your pull request.

## Credit
I won't ever take complete credit for something I didn't do or something someone helped me with. I will always credit you in the editor (visible by going to the info screen).
