## Installation
Installation is straightforward.
1. Go [to the most recent release](https://github.com/chrislo27/RhythmHeavenRemixEditor/releases/latest) and download the `RHRE_X.zip` file, where `X` is the version number.
2. Once downloaded, extract this zip file to a location like the Desktop. On Windows, open the zip file and click Extract. On macOS, use [The Unarchiver](https://theunarchiver.com/) to extract the zip file.
3. Open the extracted folder, and double click the file labeled `run_windows.bat` or `run_macOS-linux.sh` depending on your operating system.
4. Let the program download the necessary SFX if this is a first boot. You'll see something along the lines of "Receiving objects" while it loads. This may take several minutes.
5. Read the [README](http://rhre.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README/) and get remixing!
