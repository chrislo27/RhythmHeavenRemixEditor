## Installation
Installation is straightforward. Please ensure your computer meets the Requirements above.
1. Go [to the most recent release](https://github.com/chrislo27/RhythmHeavenRemixEditor/releases/latest) and download the `RHRE_X.zip` file, where `X` is the current version number.
2. Once downloaded, extract this zip file to a location like the Desktop. On Windows, open the zip file and click Extract. On macOS, use [The Unarchiver](https://theunarchiver.com/) to extract the zip file.
3. Open the extracted folder. Depending on your operating system, run the following file:
  * On Windows: double-click the `run_windows.bat` file
  * On Linux: run the `run_linux.sh` file via Terminal (`./run_linux.sh`)
4. Let the program download the necessary SFX if this is a first boot. You'll see something along the lines of "Receiving objects" while it loads. This may take several minutes.
